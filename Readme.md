# ExpenseTracker-Whatsapp

## Description
My journey to create a monthly expense tracker using Python, I used skills in file handling and data manipulation which helped me effectively manage and manipulate data from WhatsApp chat exports to analyze and track expenses.

## Skills Gained
- File Handling
- Data Manipulation
- Python

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in handling files and manipulating data in Python. I learned how to extract relevant information from WhatsApp chat exports and efficiently organize it to track monthly expenses. This project was my first significant attempt at using Python for real-world data management, providing valuable insights into practical programming applications.

## How it Works
1. Obtain the exported WhatsApp chat file containing expense information.
2. The Python script processes the chat and extracts data for the current month.
3. It categorizes the entries as expenses or cash received.
4. Expenses are calculated, and the total amount spent in the current month is displayed.
5. Cash received is also recorded, and the total amount received in the current month is displayed.

Feel free to try it out and take control of your monthly expenses with this handy tracker!
